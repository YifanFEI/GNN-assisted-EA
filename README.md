# GNN-assisted-EA
This repository is created for a technical paper published on Advanced Engineering Informatics entitled "graph neural network-assisted evolutionary algorithm for rapid optimization design of shear-wall structures". The proposed GNN-based surrogate model for predicting physical response and material usage (including the trained GNN model) is deployed on an online server and an application programming interface (API) is developed to facilitate its application. 
The API, the associated document, and relevant data for demonstration can be found in the following link: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/VzWqb1GOZt4VJwzDymHMMw 
The document, including a video tutorial, is currently in Chinese. The surrogate models, as a part of the intelligent structural design, are introduced in sections 3.4 & 3.5. Please visit our website (https://ai-structure.com/) or join our QQ group (741840451) if you are interested.
